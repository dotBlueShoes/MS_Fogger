## MS_Fogger 

Fogger is a modification for **minecraft** currently for version **1.12.2** only. The mod in it's current state cant offer much however it will give you more control over the fog then vanilla. 

Fogger gives the control of setting where the fog starts and where the fog ends. It is Possible to apply a "globalFog" that works biome independent and it is possible to define different fog lengths for different biomes. 

*Note that if the biome is not being defined in the list and the globalFog ain't set to true then the vanilla fog will be applied.*

*Note that it is recommended to not over specify biomes. Simply specify the biomes you're using in your current "minecraft" instance.* 

*Also note that the vanilla fog values are* 0.75 *for fog start and* 1.00 *for fog end.*

It is **Recommended** to use this mod alongside **Optifine** and *ResourcePacks that support biome dependent fog colors introduced by **optifine mcpacher***.

***There will be a link in future to such resourcepack crated by myself.***

### This mod does not work with

- I've tested Optifine, Phostpor, HardcoreDarkness, Serene Seasons, BiomesOPlenty and each of these work!

### Planned  Future changes

As of for now i do plan to support:

- different fog lengths on different y-levels
- different fog lengths in different weather conditions.
